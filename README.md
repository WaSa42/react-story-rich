@react-story-rich helps to create narrative games with javascript basics.

Contrary to
[Ink](https://github.com/inkle/ink) or
[Twine](https://twinery.org/),
you don't have to learn a "proxy" language to get started.
On the other hand, the library remains sufficiently low level not to restrict itself in the possibilities.
This includes:
* A tree API to parse simple story definitions in JS or even in JSON
* A navigation API to navigate through a Story Node to another
* A history reducer to keep tracks of user actions and render a timeline
* Components & hooks to handle most common interactions
